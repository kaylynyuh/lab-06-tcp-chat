## To Submit this Assignment
  * fork this repository
  * write all of your code in a directory named `lab-` + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab-duncan`
  * push to your repository
  * submit a pull request to this repository
  * submit a link to your PR in canvas
  * write a question and observation on canvas

# Include
* gitignore
* eslint
* package.json
* gulpfile
* readme
 * Write a paragraph about your project
 * Write docs on how to get the project running
 * Write docs on how to connect to the server

## Directions
* Create a TCP Server use using the net module
* Create a Clinet Constructor
* When sockets connect to the server a new `Client` instance should be made
* Clients should have a unique `id` from `node-uuid`
 * **e.g.** `2309-4802-3948-...`
* Clients should have a unique 'nickname'
 * **e.g.** `guest-43`
* When sockets are connected with the ClientPool they should be given event listeners for `data`, `error`, and `close` events
 * When a socket emits the `close` event the socket should be removed from the client pool!
 * When a socket emmits the `error` event the error should be logged on the serever
 * When a socket emmits the `data` event the data should be logged on the server and the `\wack` commands below should be implemented

# Wack commands `'\'`
* `\all` should trigger a broadcast event
* `\nick` should allow a user change their nickname
* `\dm` should allow a user to send a message directly to another user by nick name
* when a user speaks their nickname should be printed
 * **i.e.** `teapot: Sup Hacker?`

## Bonus
* 2pts Write a test that
 * that tests `\nick` actually changes a clients nickname


##About this program:
This program is a chat forum that allows clients to set up a unique username and communicate to other clients and their respective usernames via sockets. Users have the ability to send direct messages to other users as well as broadcast messages to any given number of users so long as other clients are valid with valid usernames.
